# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📌 What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a foundational phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the needs, expectations, and constraints of stakeholders are identified, documented, and validated. It serves as the blueprint for what the software system must achieve and how it should behave.

This process involves gathering detailed information from users, clients, and other stakeholders to define both functional and non-functional requirements. These requirements are then analyzed, prioritized, and structured to guide the design, development, and testing phases.

### 🔍 Why It Matters in SDLC

- **Clarity & Alignment**: It ensures that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the system’s goals and scope.
- **Prevents Scope Creep**: By clearly defining boundaries, it minimizes the risk of uncontrolled changes during development.
- **Improves Planning**: Accurate requirements lead to better estimates for time, cost, and resources.
- **Enhances Quality**: Well-defined requirements reduce ambiguity, leading to fewer bugs and rework.
- **Facilitates Validation**: Requirements serve as the basis for acceptance criteria and testing strategies.

Requirement Analysis is not just a technical task—it’s a strategic activity that bridges business needs with engineering execution. A well-executed analysis sets the stage for building scalable, maintainable, and user-centered software systems.

## 🚀 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it lays the groundwork for building software that meets user needs, business goals, and technical constraints. Here are three key reasons why it’s essential:

### 1. ✅ Prevents Scope Creep
By clearly defining what the system should and shouldn’t do, Requirement Analysis helps teams avoid unplanned features and changes. This keeps the project focused, on budget, and within timeline.

### 2. 📐 Improves Design and Development Accuracy
Well-documented requirements guide developers and designers in building the right features with the right logic. It reduces ambiguity, minimizes rework, and ensures that the system architecture aligns with user expectations.

### 3. 🧪 Enables Effective Testing and Validation
Requirements serve as the foundation for creating test cases and acceptance criteria. This ensures that the final product is verifiable, meets stakeholder expectations, and functions as intended.

## 🔧 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves a series of structured activities that help define what a software system should do and how it should behave. Below are the five key activities that form the backbone of this process:

- **📥 Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting raw information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, and existing documentation. This step ensures that all perspectives are considered before shaping the system’s functionality.

- **🧠 Requirement Elicitation**  
  Refining and clarifying gathered data to uncover hidden needs, assumptions, and constraints. Techniques include brainstorming, use case exploration, and stakeholder role analysis.

- **📝 Requirement Documentation**  
  Translating elicited requirements into structured, readable formats such as user stories, feature lists, and specification documents. This ensures clarity and traceability throughout the development lifecycle.

- **📊 Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Categorizing and prioritizing requirements, identifying dependencies, and visualizing system behavior using models like use case diagrams, flowcharts, or ER diagrams. This helps in understanding the system holistically.

- **✅ Requirement Validation**  
  Reviewing documented requirements with stakeholders to confirm accuracy, completeness, and feasibility. This step ensures alignment with business goals and sets the stage for acceptance criteria and testing.

## 📂 Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are broadly categorized into **Functional** and **Non-functional** types. Both are essential to ensure the system behaves as expected and performs reliably under real-world conditions.

### 🔧 Functional Requirements

Functional requirements describe the specific behaviors, features, and interactions the system must support. They define what the system should do.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- Users can search for available properties based on location and date.
- Guests can create an account and log in securely.
- Hosts can list new properties with details like price, availability, and amenities.
- The system allows users to book a property and receive confirmation.
- Admins can manage user accounts and moderate property listings.

### ⚙️ Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define how the system performs rather than what it does. They cover aspects like performance, security, usability, and scalability.

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- The system should load search results within 2 seconds.
- User data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- The platform should support up to 10,000 concurrent users without degradation.
- The interface must be responsive across desktop and mobile devices.
- The system should maintain 99.9% uptime with automated failover support.

## 🧩 Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams are visual representations that illustrate how different users (actors) interact with a system to achieve specific goals. They help clarify system functionality, identify user roles, and ensure that all required interactions are captured during the Requirement Analysis phase.

### 🎯 Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
- **Simplifies Communication**: Makes it easier for stakeholders to understand system behavior.
- **Clarifies Scope**: Highlights what the system will and won’t do.
- **Supports Validation**: Helps verify that all user interactions are accounted for.
- **Guides Development**: Serves as a blueprint for designing features and user flows.

The diagram below outlines the key actors and use cases for the booking system:

- **Actors**:
  - Guest
  - Host
  - Admin

- **Use Cases**:
  - Search Properties
  - Create Booking
  - Cancel Booking
  - Register/Login
  - List Property
  - Edit/Delete Property
  - Manage Users
  - Moderate Listings

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are predefined conditions that a software feature must satisfy to be considered complete and acceptable by stakeholders. They serve as a bridge between requirements and implementation, ensuring that developers, testers, and clients share a common understanding of what “done” looks like.

### 🔍 Importance in Requirement Analysis

- **Clarifies Expectations**: Prevents ambiguity by defining exactly what a feature should do.
- **Guides Development**: Helps developers focus on delivering functionality that meets user needs.
- **Enables Testability**: Provides a basis for writing test cases and verifying feature completeness.
- **Supports Validation**: Ensures that stakeholders can confidently approve features during review.

### 🛒 Example: Checkout Feature – Booking Management System

**Feature**: Checkout Process for Booking a Property

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ User must be logged in to initiate checkout.
- ✅ Selected property details (name, price, dates) are displayed during checkout.
- ✅ Payment options (credit card, mobile money) are available and selectable.
- ✅ Booking confirmation is shown after successful payment.
- ✅ System sends a confirmation email with booking details to the user.
- ✅ If payment fails, user is notified and prompted to retry or cancel.
- ✅ Booking is stored in the user’s account history upon success.
